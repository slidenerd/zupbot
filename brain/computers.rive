- \n One of the biggest challenges facing a Java application\n developer is finding a "lowest common denominator" subset of the\n Java language that works on all the platforms and versions\n out there. The Java language itself is a moving target.\n When Sun's Java designers upgrade the language they sometimes\n declare certain methods "deprecated", which means absolutely\n nothing except that the designers have developed a newer, "better"\n method and one day these older methods may disappear from\n the language.
